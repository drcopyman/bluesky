# Blue Sky FiveM Framework
Blue Sky Framework is a custom built framework for [BlueSky-Development](https://github.com/BlueSky-Development)'s roleplay server, a now cancelled project.

__This Project Has Been Abandoned And Will *NOT* Receive Any Further Official Updates, This Code Is Being Made Available Purely To Give Ideas To The FiveM Community To Expand Beyond The Shitty Performant Piles Of Crap That Currently Infest That Entire Community. If You're Interested In Maintaining This Project, And Are Capable Of Doing So Feel Free To Reach Out To Me On Discord Alzar#0001__

### __NOTE: THIS WILL *NOT* WORK OUT OF THE BOX AS THERE ARE OTHER COMPONNENTS SUCH AS A CUSTOM INVISION POWER BOARD APPLICATION THAT WAS INTENDED TO BE USED THAT IS NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. IF YOU'RE WANTING TO USE THIS, IT'S ON YOU TO MAKE THE EDITS TO GET IT TO WORK WITHOUT THAT APPLICATION__

-----

This was a framework that was originally created by [Discworld](https://github.com/DiscworldZA) & myself (Alzar) for [BlueSky-Development](https://github.com/BlueSky-Development)'s roleplay server, it was later retooled for PixelWorldRP which then later rebranded to React RP.

As the founder & owner of [BlueSky-Development](https://github.com/BlueSky-Development), [Discworld](https://github.com/DiscworldZA) agreed to allow me (Alzar) permission to take this framework to PixelWorld RP / React RP. ChrisRogersUK (Or any server he is, or was, associated with) does not, and has never, had ownership of this framework or any associated code. After the React RP project died, [Discworld](https://github.com/DiscworldZA) & myself (Alzar) decided to open source our work as neither of us plan to continue in the FiveM scene and see no reason to keep our work private.
